# Tissot

This project showcases the globe projection feature in MapLibre GL JS v5 pre-release.

## Demo: [https://01100100.github.io/tissot/](https://01100100.github.io/tissot/)

It displays two maps next to each other and in sync, one with the standard web-mecartor and the other using a globe/[Orthographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic_map_projection) projection.

Both are overlaid with a graticules grid to show the distortion of the projection.

You can drag around to visualize the different map projections side by side.

Pressing the 'Projection' button in the top right corner will display the selected map viewport overlaid on the other map.
