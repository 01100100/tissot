# Tissot

This project showcases the globe projection feature in MapLibre GL JS v5 pre-release. It displays two maps next to each other and in sync, one with the standard web-mecartor and the other using a globe/[Orthographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic_map_projection) projection. Both are overlayed with a graticules grid and of Tissot's indicatrices to show the distortion of the projection.

You can drag around to visualize different map projections side by side.
